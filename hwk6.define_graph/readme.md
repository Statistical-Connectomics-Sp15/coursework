In Fino 2011, they pose a question regarding connection selectivity between sGFP and PC cells (can find the paper in the google drive folder if you forget).
What your homework for Tuesday 4/13 is, is the following:
- type up a 1 page document suggesting how you would redefine our graph from Fino presented in class (i.e. redefine nodes and edges) OR
- type up a 1 page document arguing why you think that in this case it is not possible using graph theory approaches
