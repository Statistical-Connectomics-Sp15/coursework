## Instructions: 

Don't run the genbold and genboldavg scripts. The genbold scripts were used to create the matrices used in FinProj_total. The FinProj_total is the only script you need to run. It 
should download two .mat files and one .csv from dropbox and then run appropriately to produce the plots as seen in the report. 
Note: I was a bit excessive with for loops, so it may take a while to run... about 5 minutes altogether.
