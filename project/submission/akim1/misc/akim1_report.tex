\section*{Effects of Spatial Resolution on Accurate Determination of Graph Connectivitiy}

\paragraph{Opportunity}
The ability to measure individual connectomes holds great promise in advancing
our knowledge of the brain and consciousness. Despite these promises, current
technology and state of knowledge prevents us from rescaling this measurement
process into a computational problem that can be solved within a reasonable
time with finite resources. The complexity of the problem inevitably poses a
challenge both in validation of data and establishment of a consensus dataset.
This proposal posits that one factor that may contribute to these challenges is
the spatial resolution at which the data is obtained.

\paragraph{Challenge}
Previous studies have explored the role of resolution in NMR studies of
connectomes \cite{cammoun2012mapping}. Despite the fact that a voxel is the
elementary unit of NMR imaging, voxels, themselves, represent information from
collections of neurons.  Thus, there exists an inherent loss of information
that results from the observation of aggregate behaviors.  Individual ``hub''
neurons \cite{crossley2014hubs} can be embedded in these aggregates, and their
activities can be drowned out by the presence of their neighbors. In this
study, a purely computational approach was taken to study the implications of
observing aggregate behavior and resulting potential information loss.

\paragraph{Action}
A neuron connectivity network was generated based on a stochastic block model.
The block identity of each neuron was assigned based on their relative location
in a 2-dimensional grid. In one limiting case, contiguous pixels were assigned
to one block (nonrand case), while in another limiting case, all pixels were
randomly assigned to a block (rand case). An intermediate case was also
explored where a probability distribution was used to create a mixture of the
two limiting cases (mix case).  Once the connectivity network was generated,
the network was coarsened by combining the spatial and connective properties of
pixels in a two-by-two square into one new pixel. K-means clustering was
performed on this new coarsened grid to qualitatively characterize any notable
losses of information in respect to true information and non-coarsened data.

\paragraph{Resolution}
Representation of the adjacency matrices shows the geometric delineation of the
pixels and their respective connections. Coarsening the 2-dimensional grid led
to a decrease in sparsity as shown across all three different cases.  Next,
k-means clustering was used to correctly recapitulate the true information in
the non-random and mixture cases. Whether the true information was correctly
determined in both random cases is difficult to ascertain from the generated
figure. Coarsening the data led to the introduction of artifacts at the
boundaries in the nonrandom and mixture case. Furthermore, there is a
significant decrease in the heterogeneity of the region as a result of
coarsening, suggesting that important neuronal activity is lost in aggregate
information.

\paragraph{Future Work}
Much of the work presented in this report is limited by the availability of
computational resources. Future work would include the expansion of the
analysis into 3-dimensions with significantly greater number of pixels and
inclusion of physiological regions. A rigorous framework would also be
established to determine statistical confidence, and empirical data would be
used to validate these findings.
