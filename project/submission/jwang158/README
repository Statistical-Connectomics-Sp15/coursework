README

This software attempts to look deeper into the methodologies used in
the Shehzad 2014 paper on Connectome-Wide Association Studies (CWAS).

Instructions

1. Run main.m in matlab (does not require X11).
2. Find results printed to stdout
3. Find final figure written to p-values_CWAS.jpg
4. Find sample outputs in example_out/

Please refer to the attached report for mathematical details.


***Special Note on replicating Shehzad 2014 results:
This is a personal account of how I tried to replicate the results as
published by Shezad et al. and failed.
 
I first tried to get a hold of the dataset they used, which I found
was called the ADHD-200 dataset. There seemed to be a sizable
community working on this set because I had to make an account with
them in order to have access to the data and I was pleasantly
bombarded with issues they were having in my email.

After waiting for around a week, they finally approved my access and I
was able to get the data. First, I found that the data by itself was
unusable because there were multiple updates and fixes and it took me
a lot of work just to get the data to be usable.

Next, I followed the paper's instructions and installed C-PAC using
their installation script for Ubuntu on my Ubuntu machine. Little did
I know, the installation took around 2 hours just to complete and
required downloading about 6 GB of data just to run.

Despite the setbacks, I was still optimistic about the program working
because I used their Ubuntu-specific script in the exact same software
environment that it was written for. I was wrong. 

After digging through their massive documentation and tweaking over 20
required parameters, I was still not able to get any functional result.
I decided it would be best for me to generate this data theoretically
and eventually gave up trying to run their code.
