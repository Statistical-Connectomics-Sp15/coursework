The project for this class consists of three parts:
- proposal
- final report
- code

The goal of this project is to pose a statistic decision theoretic question relating to the field of connectomics. You will pose this question in the proposal, receive some feedback from your TA and instructor, then proceed to solve this problem.

At the end of the term, you will summarize your work into a 1-2 page document highlighting what you've done and it's significance. You will submit your code and the report. The code you submit must execute and come with a readme file which indicates to the grader how they can run it (please speak to us before considering languages other than R, Python, and MATLAB to ensure we can execute your code)
