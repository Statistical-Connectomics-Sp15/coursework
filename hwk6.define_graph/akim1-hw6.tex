\section{Introduction}
One of the goals of this proposal is to lay out a framework for determining
rigorously whether patterns that arise from a nodal network is dependent or
independent in nature.

One approach to determining the dependency of a particular pattern is to
determine a model to be used, such as the stochastic block model. A network
will be generated using the stochastic block model. After which, the network
will be inspected for formation of triangle patterns. The number of triangles
will be quantified. This process will be repeated for different parameters of
the model.

At the end, a t-test will be performed, and the number of triangles will be
compared to the one generated by the stochastic block model and the ones
observed in data. It is assumed that if these two processes are not independent,
then the number of triangles generated by the stochastic block model should be
comparable to the one observed in data.
