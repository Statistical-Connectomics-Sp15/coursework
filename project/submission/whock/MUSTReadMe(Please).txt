%% ReadMe for Will Hockeimer Statistical Connectomics Final Project

To run:

1) Critical that you toggle matplotlib interactive / pop-out graphs ON. If you don't graphs will freeze.
   To do so in IPython: %matplotlib qt

2) Enter: %run StatConnProject.py

3) Graphs will hopefully generate. Maximize them to see data.
