1)Download final_project_david_lee_with_data.mat and put it in your MATLAB directory along with the wget.exe file.  
2)Run the matlab file, it should import three graphs (Time1.mat, Time2.mat, Time3.mat). 
3)From these three graphs it will generate 4 more graph, outputting a total of 7 figures.
4)Figures may take a while to run so patient :)
5)Due to random variation in the algorithm, the output figures may look slightly different from the ones posted on the PDF, but overall they should be similar
6)MAKE SURE THAT THE MATLAB VERSION IS 2014, it has problems running on older versions.
7)If wget does not work, there is a backup file that manually inputs data from the github repository. Run this instead. 
(I know that uploading data bloats github and is bad practice, but the data was only 3-4kb).
8)graph_generator.m was the code used to create the graphs and is only there for reference.
